                        Does Dr. Martens charge sales tax?

                        Yes, Dr. Martens does collect sales tax in states that require online retailers to collect sales tax on orders shipped into that state.<br>The tax rate applied will be based on the type of item purchased and will be the combined state and local rate for the address to which your order is shipped.

                    <p>
                        There are a few possible reasons why your payment didn't go through. Most often, the billing address provided does not match the "Master Address" that your issuing bank has on file.<br>If your billing address is correct and the transaction still isn't going through, please contact us. Our customer service team will be able to diagnose the problem and provide a solution.<br>In the event of a declined transaction, you may see pending charges on your account. These are authorization holds placed by your bank when the transaction is attempted; money has not been removed from your account. Authorization holds typically take about 1-2 business days to clear, however this timeline is dependent on your issuing bank. This process can often be expedited by contacting your bank.

                        Please keep in mind that the easiest way to confirm the size that you received matched the size of the item that was ordered is to refer to the UK size on the packaging. Not all of our styles are going to show the size options for both US Men and US Women's on the packaging.

                            - Our Made In England line will show the UK size on the tongue of the item, while the box will show the UK size and the US Men's size.

                        <li>

                        <li>
                            - Our insoles typically will show the UK Size as well as the US Men's size shown as "US".
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - For all styles, the US Men's size is one higher than the UK size and the US Women’s size is two higher than the UK size. This also means that the US Women’s size is one higher than the US Men’s size.

                        We only offer whole sizes. If you normally wear a half size, we recommend trying the closest size down as many styles tend to run large. However, the fit may vary slightly depending on the style.

                        How can I find the correct laces for my shoes?
                    </b>
                    <p>
                        You can find the correct shoelace laces length by counting the lace eyelets on your shoe and matching it with the corresponding lace length. Shoelaces in our online store will also have the recommended eyelet length in the product name.

                        The only footwear we guarantee for life is from our discontinued For Life Collection. This line has historically been made up of several versions of our classic 1460 and 1461 that have additional comfort and durability features and are accompanied with registration materials when purchased. You can also tell that the shoes are For Life because they have the name embedded in a small square on the bottom sole.
