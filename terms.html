                From March 31st 2018, the For Life range has been discontinued. Dr. Martens will continue to honor all existing For Life guarantees on purchases made before March 31st 2018, and registered within 60 days of purchase. The guarantee applies only to the For Life boots and shoes with the words "Guaranteed For Life" on the sole that were purchased and registered prior to the dates above. The guarantee covers the failure of any component, such as upper leather, stitched seams, eyelets, soles, welts, linings and reinforcements which has been subjected to normal wear and tear from non-industrial use and not unreasonably abused. The guarantee will be active from the day on which the original owner activates his/her guarantee, to the end of that person's natural life.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to determine whether to repair or replace the footwear. If we deem a replacement necessary, discontinued or unavailable models will be replaced with a comparable model (excluding Made in England). A fee will be required per claim to cover handling, administration, return postage and packing. The guarantee is subject to US Law and is in addition to the owner's statutory rights.

                Digital Millennium Copyright Act
            </h3>
            <p>
                A. Written DMCA Notice. If you are a copyright owner, or an agent of a copyright owner, and believe that a User Submission or other content displayed on this Site infringes your copyright, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing Dr. Martens’ Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail): 1 Physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; 2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; 3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material; 4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail; 5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and 6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Dr. Martens’ designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is: [name] [address] [phone numbers]. Only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright Agent. If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 5(D), your DMCA notice may not be valid. B. Written DMCA Counter-Notice. If you believe that your User Submission that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to have your User Submission posted and used on this Site, then you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent: 1. Your physical or electronic signature; 2. Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled; 3. A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and 4. Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in Portland, Oregon, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. If a counter-notice is received by the Dr. Martens Copyright Agent, then Dr. Martens may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in ten (10) business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Dr. Martens’ sole discretion.
