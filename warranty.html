                Limited Warranty Statement
            </h3>
            <p>
                Dr. Martens AirWair USA LLC (“Dr. Martens,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) warrants to the original purchaser that their Dr. Martens-branded footwear (“Product(s)”) will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for one (1) year from the date of purchase (“Warranty Period”). The Warranty Period is not extended if we repair or replace the Product. We may change the availability of this limited warranty at our discretion, but any changes will not be retroactive.
            </p>

        <div class="paragraphFooter">
            <h3>
                Warranty Applicability
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Limited Warranty applies to authentic Products purchased at Dr. Martens’ retail stores in the United States, at www.drmartens.com/us for delivery within the United States, and from Dr. Martens’ authorized resellers within the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Because Dr. Martens cannot control the quality of products sold by unauthorized sellers, the Limited Warranty applies only to Products that were purchased from Dr. Martens or a Dr. Martens authorized seller, unless otherwise prohibited by law. Dr. Martens reserves the right to reject warranty claims from purchasers for Products purchased from unauthorized sellers, including unauthorized Internet sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                - In the event that you purchased a Dr. Martens Product with defective material or workmanship from a Dr. Martens authorized reseller, for fastest service, we recommend you to first check with the place of purchase for their assistance. If you are not able to return an item to the original place of purchase, you still may be able to receive service for the item directly through Dr. Martens.

                Exclusions
            </h3>
            <p>
                Removable components that come with a shoe, including, but not limited to, shoelaces, swing-tags, and insoles, are not eligible for replacement. In addition, the Limited Warranty does not cover damages or defects caused by: improper use; failure to follow the product care instructions or to perform any recommended preventive maintenance; modifications and tampering; unauthorized repairs; consistent with ordinary wear and tear, or overuse; or external causes such as accidents, improper use and abuse, exposure to extreme elements (e.g., extreme moisture, temperature, direct sun), or other actions or events beyond our reasonable control. Only original, unaltered, and unmodified materials and workmanship are covered by the Limited Warranty.

                How to Request Warranty Service
            </h3>
            <p>
                If you believe your Product has a defect covered by the Limited Warranty, to submit a valid warranty claim, you must contact us within the applicable Warranty Period and follow these steps: you must include (a) photographs of your Product showing the alleged defect, (b) a description of the alleged defect, and (c) a receipt or other proof of your purchase from Dr. Martens or one of its authorized resellers that identifies the seller and the transaction date. You will also be required to confirm your name, contact information and other details about the product you purchased (such as product code, style, color, size, etc.). Depending on the nature of the alleged defect, we may also require you to return the product to us for inspection.

                Warranty Process
            </h3>
            <p>
                If we determine that the Product has a defect covered under the Limited Warranty, we will, at our discretion, either (a) authorize you to have the Product repaired and reimburse you for the reasonable cost of repair, (b) send you a replacement Product or other Product of equivalent value, or (c) issue you a coupon code with a credit equivalent to the original purchase price. Depending on the season or Product, it may take longer to process your claim or repair certain items. All replacement Product is subject to availability at the time your claim is confirmed.

                If we determine your Product must be returned, we will issue you a return shipping label. If your warranty claim is confirmed, Dr. Martens will cover the cost of shipping a replacement Product provided your shipping address is within the United States. Additional charges may apply for shipping to or from an international shipping address, depending on your location.
